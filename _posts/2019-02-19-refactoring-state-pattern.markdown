In this series of [code refactoring](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/tags/code-refactor) posts we are discussing how design patterns can be used to make our Ruby code beautiful, maintainable and clean.

Today I want to talk about a pattern that can be very useful when we need to control the flow of a set of events of our objects: *The State Pattern* or a.k.a *Finite State Machine*.

As a developer it's something common to see objects changing of states. At the beginning manage the state of an object can be as simple as have some boolean attributes where you can check if the object is in state A or B. But when the complexity is increasing you can end up with a number of states that is difficulty to manage without break the [SOLID principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod). That is where we can benefit of the elegant solution the State Pattern give to us.

## The State Pattern

According to the [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state): <strong>_"The main idea of the State patter is that, at any given moment, thereâ€™s a finite number of states which a object can be in. Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously._</strong>

Think in the solution as a [finite sate machine](https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/) where you can control your objects making sure that it can be in only one state at the same time, so the objects will transit from one state to another to perform a set of different actions.

Here at Ombulabs a good example of when we need to use state pattern it's in one of our products, the [Ombushop](https://secure.ombushop.com). It's an e-commerce platform where a user can create it's customized store and sell products online.

One of the objects we need to handle is the `Order` (of course), which will change of state several times until we can say that the order is complete. The order if first created when the buyer adds a product to the cart, then if the buyer is in the checkout page the order will change to checkout state, when the payment is done we need to change the order to pending and that way the order will move from one state to other until it's completed or canceled. This is a very typical scenario where we can use the state.

## Show me the code

State machines are usually implemented with lots of conditional operators that select the appropriate behavior depending on the current state of the object. In ruby we could do something like:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  def change_state
    case state
    when "cart"
      state = "paying"
    when "paying"
      state = "payment_pending"
    when "payment_pending"
      state = "complete"
    when "complete"
      state = "delivered"
    else "complete"
      state = "cart"
    end
  end
end
```

Doesn't feel good, right? What if you need to do some validations before allow to change to the next state? What if I need to go back to a previous state? The code would be more complex and the `change_state` method would clearly have more than one responsibility. We can solve this problem by applying the state pattern.

There are a few gems that can help us with this job, but I recommend the [AASM gem](https://github.com/aasm/aasm) because it's easy to understand and implement, we just need to include the gem into our model and start to set our states:

Back to Ombushop's code, using the assm we can refactor the `Order` model like this:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include AASM

  aasm(column: 'state') do
    state :cart, initial: true
    state :checkout, before_enter: :update_totals!
    state :pending
    state :completed, after_enter: :finalize!
    state :delivered
    state :canceled
    state :resumed,
    state :returned,
    state :paying

    event :next do
      transitions from: :cart, to: :checkout
      transitions from: :checkout, to: :paying
    end

    event :pending do
      transitions from: [:checkout, :paying], to: :pending
    end

    event :payment_received do
      transitions from: :pending, to: :paid
    end

    event :cancel do
      transitions to: :canceled
    end

    # ... several other events here
  end
```

First of all we need to tell aasm what is the column used to save the state. Then we need to add all possible states (remember that we need to have a finite number of states) and set which one is the initial state. Them in the `event` blocks we can start to define the flow between the states. Simple like that.

As you probably noticed we can also define callback functions to be called if we need to do any action before or after the object transition to some state.

AASS also give some useful methods such like:

```ruby
  order = Order.new
  order.pending? # => true
  order.pending
  order.may_complete? # => true
  order.complete
  order.completed? # => true
```

This can help us to manage the states in our code more efficiently without to create a lot of extra methods. It also makes easier to add a new state if you ever need in the future.

## Conclusion
Handle the states of an object is a hard job by itself. In this article we saw how apply the state pattern can make our life better offering a solution to this. Next time that you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is finite and the object change of state frequently remember of this important design pattern.

I hope that this article will be useful for you. We will keep talking about principles and patterns here in our blog, so stay tuned!
