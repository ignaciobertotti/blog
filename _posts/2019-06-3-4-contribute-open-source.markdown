Contributing to open source might be scary, you might think that you pull request (PR) is not good enough; that people will judge you by your code; or that fixing that little typo is not worth it.

I had all these questions in my head before I submitted my first contribution to an open source project and it stopped me many times.

So my suggestions is, start small, look for low hanging issues in a project you want to contribute, start looking at the issues and see if they have been solved previously and suggest a fix, by doing this you will start learning the code base and it will give you confidence to start tackling more complex issues.

This is a set of steps that would help you get started in your open source journey:

### If you think you found a bug:
1. Search in Stack Overflow
2. Search in GitHub's Issues
3. If I don't find anything anywhere, submit an issue
4. If I know a patch that works, submit a PR
5. Wait for feedback

### If you think something will be a nice feature:
1. Search in GitHub's Issues if that feature is already proposed
2. If you don't find anything in the issue tracker, submit an issue explaining why you think your feature will add value to the project
3. Wait for feeback
4. if you got a positive feedback about your feature, submit a PR
5. Wait for feddback


These steps are not written in gold, but i think they might help you get you started.
There are situations where i personally wouldn't submit an issue first, i.e typos, formatting issues, etc
but this depends on how large is the change and how well you know the codebase.
