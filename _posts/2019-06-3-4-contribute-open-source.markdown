Contributing to open source might be scary, you might think that you pull request (PR) is not good enough; that people will judge you by your code; or that fixing that little typo is not worth it.

I had all these questions in my head before I submitted my first contribution to an open source project and it stopped me many times.

So my suggestion is: start small. Look for low hanging issues in a project you want to contribute to; start reviewing issues; and see if they have been solved in the past. Then you can suggest a fix. If you take it one small issue at a time, you will start learning the code base and it will give you the confidence you need to start tackling more complex issues.

Before getting started make sure you know the basics of version control and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)

> Note: I'll be focusing on GitHub as the platform to contribute since is the most popular.

## This is a set of steps that would help you get started in your open source journey:

### If you think you found a bug

1. Look in the web to check the bug aleady exists
2. If you don't find anything anywhere, submit an issue to the project repository explaining what you found and how you expected the program to behave and what you are getting
3. If you know a patch that works, submit a PR
4. Wait for feedback and make changes to you PR if the maintainers of the project have any until the PR is ready to merge!

### If you think something will be a nice feature

1. Look in the web to check the feaure was already proposed or what other people think of your feature; if the feature is already proposed and you think you can improve it, comment your ideas about it.
2. If you don't find anything in the web, issue tracker, etc, submit an issue explaining why you think your feature will add value to the project
3. Wait for feeback from the project maintainers and learn about why your feature is or not addecuate to the project
4. If you got a positive feedback about your feature, start working on your feature and dont' get scared to ask for help if you get stuck. Finaly submit a PR!
5. Wait for feddback again! you are getting closer! maintainers of the project will give you more feedback about the feature; don't take the feedback personal and discuss the feedback if you disagree with something it might be a good way to learn from one and other.

### Triaging issue
You might or not have a feature of issue to fix, another good way you could start contributing is by simply looking at the github issues, start checking if there are issues that are solved and notify the maintainers that the issue should be closed or if you see a feature maybe you could give feedback about it or maybe you could start reviewing existing PR's! the goal here is to lose the fear and to motivate you get involve in the project you choosed.

## Conclusion

These steps are not written in gold, but I think they might help you get you started.
There are situations where I personally wouldn't submit an issue first, i.e typos, formatting issues, etc
but this depends on how large is the change and how well you know the codebase.
